1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,773
<i>Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.</i>

2
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,735
<i>Because of something that happened
before I was even born.</i>

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,780
<i>See, a long time ago,
there was this family.</i>

4
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,988
<i>The</i> papá, <i>he was a musician.</i>

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,619
<i>He and his family would sing
and dance and count their blessings.</i>

6
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,673
<i>But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.</i>

7
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:40,640
<i>And one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.</i>

8
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,684
<i>And the</i> mamá...

9
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,611
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

10
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>After banishing all music from her life
she found a way...</i>

11
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,532
<i>to provide for her daughter.</i>

12
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,877
<i>She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.</i>

13
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:20,555
<i>She could have made candy,
or fireworks, or sparkly underwear...</i>

14
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:25,685
<i>for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.</i>

15
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,560
<i>Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.</i>

16
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,485
<i>And later, she taught her son-in-law.</i>

17
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,730
<i>Then her grandkids got roped in.</i>

18
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,072
<i>As her family grew,
so did the business.</i>

19
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,410
<i>Music had torn her family apart.</i>

20
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,538
<i>But shoes held them all together.</i>

21
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,415
<i>You see, that woman was my great-
great-grandmother,</i> Mamá <i>Imelda.</i>

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,047
<i>She died way before I was born.</i>

23
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,091
<i>But my family still tells her story
every year on</i> Día de los Muertos...

24
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,599
<i>the Day of the Dead.</i>

25
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,767
<i>And her little girl, she's my
great-grandmother,</i> Mamá <i>Coco.</i>

26
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,227
<i>Hola, Mamá</i> Coco.

27
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,938
How are you, Julio?

28
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,270
<i>Actually, my name is Miguel.</i>

29
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,025
Mamá <i>Coco has trouble
remembering things.</i>

30
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,195
<i>But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.</i>

31
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,499
I used to run like this. But now
I run like this which is way faster.

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,953
And the winner is <i>Luchadora</i> Coco!

33
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,376
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

34
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,332
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

35
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,544
Miguel, eat your food.

36
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,088
<i>My</i> abuelita, <i>she's</i>
Mamá <i>Coco's daughter.</i>

37
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,258
Oh, you're a twig, <i>mijo.</i>
Have some more.

38
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,425
No, <i>gracias.</i>

39
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,720
I asked if you would like more tamales!

40
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,933
<i>Sí?</i>

41
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,440
That's what I thought you said!

42
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,902
Abuelita <i>runs our house
just like</i> Mamá <i>Imelda did.</i>

43
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,905
No music!

44
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,609
No music!

45
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,904
<i>- Y aunque la vida</i>
- No music!

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,537
<i>I think we're the only family in México
who hates music.</i>

47
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,086
<i>And my family's fine with that. But me...</i>

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,338
- Be back by lunch, <i>mijo.</i>
- Love you, <i>Mamá.</i>

49
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,008
<i>I am not like the rest of my family!</i>

50
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,677
<i>- Hola,</i> Miguel!
<i>- Hola!</i>

51
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,848
<i>- Muchas gracias.
- De nada,</i> Miguel.

52
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,268
Hey! Dante!

53
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,490
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

54
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,445
Fist bump!

55
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,485
Good boy, Dante!

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,950
<i>I know I'm not supposed to love music.</i>

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,461
<i>But it's not my fault! It's his!</i>

58
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,217
<i>Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.</i>

59
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:07,881
Right here in this very plaza,
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

60
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,426
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Méxican history.

61
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,056
<i>He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,235
<i>But when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.</i>

63
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,896
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

64
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,238
<i>He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!</i>

65
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,120
<i>And he wrote the best songs.</i>

66
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,072
<i>But my all-time favorite, it's...</i>

67
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,910
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

68
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,749
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,542
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

70
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,425
<i>Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away</i>

71
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,256
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

72
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,057
<i>Each night we are apart
Remember me</i>

73
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,183
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

74
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,932
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

75
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,267
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

76
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,564
<i>Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be</i>

77
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,609
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

78
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,774
<i>He lived the kind of life
you dream about.</i>

79
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,954
<i>Until 1942.</i>

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,997
<i>When he was crushed by a giant bell.</i>

81
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,376
<i>I want to be just like him.</i>

82
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:34,222
<i>Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
I get this feeling like we're connected.</i>

83
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:39,643
<i>Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.</i>

84
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,482
If it wasn't for my family.

85
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,944
<i>- Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.</i>
- Huh?

86
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,230
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

87
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,818
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

88
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,656
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

89
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,822
If I were you, I'd march
right up to my family and say...

90
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,332
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

91
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,869
- I could never say that.
- You are a musician, no?

92
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,832
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.

93
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,841
Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his skills?

94
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,975
No! He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud.

95
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,931
<i>Mira, mira,</i> they're
setting up for tonight!

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,893
The music competition
for <i>Día de Muertos.</i>

97
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,516
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

98
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,935
Uh-uh. My family would freak!

99
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,988
Look, if you're too scared
then, well, have fun making shoes.

100
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,609
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

101
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,695
Seize your moment?

102
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,952
Show me what you got, <i>muchacho.</i>

103
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,125
I'll be your first audience.

104
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,383
Miguel!

105
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,883
<i>- Abuelita!</i>
- What are you doing here?

106
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,009
You leave my grandson alone.

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,101
<i>Doña,</i> please! I was just getting a shine.

108
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,306
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,936
He was just showing me his guitar.

110
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,187
Shame on you.

111
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:12,065
My grandson is a sweet little
<i>angelito querido cielito.</i>

112
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,160
He wants no part of your music,
mariachi. You keep away from him.

113
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,250
<i>Ay, pobrecito.</i> Oh, <i>estás bien, mijo.</i>

114
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,664
You know better than to
be here in this place!

115
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,925
You will come home. Now.

116
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,272
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

117
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,769
Yes, <i>Tío</i> Berto.

118
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,403
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Go away, you. Go!

119
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,733
It's just Dante.

120
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,947
Never name a street dog. They'll follow
you forever. Now, go get my shoe.

121
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,872
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

122
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,203
<i>Ay,</i> Miguel!

123
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,414
You know how <i>Abuelita</i> feels
about the plaza.

124
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,299
- I was just shining shoes.
- A musician's shoes!

125
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,463
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

126
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,258
If <i>Abuelita</i> says no more plaza,
then no more plaza.

127
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,476
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

128
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,106
Well, they're having this talent show.
And I thought I might...

129
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,226
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

130
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,528
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

131
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,323
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

132
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,071
It's <i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

133
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,325
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

134
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,285
<i>Ofrenda</i> room<i>. Vámonos.</i>

135
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,798
Don't give me that look.

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,634
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> is
the one night of the year

137
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,640
our ancestors can come visit us.

138
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,804
We've put their photos on the <i>ofrenda</i>
so their spirits can cross over.

139
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,767
That is very important.

140
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,687
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,104
We made all this food, set out
the things they loved in life, <i>mijo.</i>

142
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,365
All this work to bring
the family together.

143
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:23,659
I don't want you sneaking off to who
knows where. Where are you going?

144
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,784
I thought we were done.

145
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,619
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i> Being part of this family
means being here for this family.

146
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,456
- I don't want to see you end up like--
- Like <i>Mamá</i> Coco's <i>papá?</i>

147
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,629
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

148
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,709
But you're the one who--

149
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,920
I was just--

150
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,299
But-- I--

151
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,554
<i>Papá? Papá</i> is home?

152
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,477
<i>Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.</i>

153
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,974
<i>Papá</i> is coming home?

154
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,398
No, <i>Mamá.</i> It's okay. I'm here.

155
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,151
Who are you?

156
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,899
Rest, <i>Mamá.</i>

157
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:02,819
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel? Miguel?

158
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,081
What are we going to do with that boy?

159
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,045
You're right. That's just what he needs.

160
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,648
It's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,532
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.

162
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,292
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

163
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,501
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

164
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,084
<i>Perfecto!</i>

165
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,828
<i>I have to sing. I have to play!</i>

166
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,754
<i>The music, it's not just in me, it is me.</i>

167
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,633
<i>When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.</i>

168
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,678
<i>The rest of the world may follow
the rules, but I must follow my heart.</i>

169
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,683
<i>You know that feeling
like there's a song in the air and...</i>

170
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,191
<i>it's playing just for you?</i>

171
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,282
<i>A feeling so close...</i>

172
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:10,238
<i>you could reach out and touch it</i>

173
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:15,952
<i>I never knew I could want
something so much, but it's true</i>

174
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,663
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

175
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,165
<i>Oh, but,</i> Padre, <i>he will never listen.</i>

176
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,004
<i>He will listen. To music.</i>

177
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:29,383
<i>Only a song, only a song
has the power to change a heart</i>

178
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,556
<i>Never underestimate
the power of music.</i>

179
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,397
<i>But my father,
he will never give his permission.</i>

180
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,190
<i>I am done asking permission.</i>

181
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,155
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

182
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,070
<i>You must seize it!</i>

183
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,165
Señor <i>de la Cruz, what did it take
for you to seize your moment?</i>

184
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,706
<i>I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.</i>

185
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,049
<i>It was up to me to reach for that dream.</i>

186
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,586
<i>- Grab it tight and make it come true.
- ...and make it come true.</i>

187
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,720
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

188
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,144
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

189
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,526
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> has begun!

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,364
No, no. We have to make a clear path.

191
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,951
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

192
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,118
We want them to come and enjoy
all the food and drinks on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

193
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,122
<i>Mamá!</i> Where should we put this table?

194
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,790
In the courtyard, <i>mijos.</i>

195
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,085
- You want it down by the kitchen?
<i>- Sí.</i> Next to the other one.

196
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,092
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

197
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,595
Nothing! <i>Mamá, Papá.</i> I--

198
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,191
Miguel, your <i>abuelita</i> had
the most wonderful idea.

199
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,399
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

200
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,570
What?

201
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,989
No more shining shoes.

202
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,909
You'll be making them every day
after school.

203
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:17,615
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
the family tradition.

204
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,711
And on <i>Día de los Muertos!</i>
Your ancestors will be so proud.

205
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,423
You'll craft huaraches
just like your <i>Tía</i> Victoria.

206
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,172
And wingtips like your <i>Papá</i> Julio.

207
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,678
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

208
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,348
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.

209
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:40,312
You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...

210
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,020
A shoemaker. Through and through.

211
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,020
That's my boy! Berto!

212
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,939
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

213
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,376
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

214
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,265
No, no, no, no, no! No.

215
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,400
De la Cruz's guitar?

216
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,738
<i>Papá? Papá?</i>

217
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,867
<i>Mamá</i> Coco,
is your <i>papá</i> Ernesto de la Cruz?

218
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,408
<i>Papá! Papá!</i>

219
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,095
<i>Papá! Papá!</i> It's him!

220
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,181
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

221
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,925
Miguel, get down from there.

222
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,974
<i>Mamá</i> Coco's father was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

223
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,774
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna be a musician!

224
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,025
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?

225
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,946
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

226
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,901
- Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
- It's not a fantasy.

227
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,913
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!

228
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,785
We've never known anything
about this man!

229
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,164
But whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

230
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,911
This is no future for my son.

231
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,588
But, <i>Papá,</i> you said
my family would guide me.

232
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,088
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

233
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,634
I'm supposed to play music.

234
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,881
Never! That man's music was a curse.
I will not allow it.

235
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,637
- If you would just let--
- Miguel...

236
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,518
You will listen to your family.
No more music.

237
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,810
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

238
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,981
You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten?

239
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,486
Left off your family's <i>ofrenda?</i>

240
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,148
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

241
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,364
- No!
<i>- Mamá!</i>

242
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,710
There. No guitar. No music.

243
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:16,419
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat
with your family.

244
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,469
I don't want to be in this family!

245
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,763
Miguel! Miguel!

246
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,495
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up?

247
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,700
You got an instrument?

248
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,575
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

249
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,372
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

250
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,960
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

251
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,131
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, <i>muchacho.</i>

252
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,633
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

253
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,888
- I need a guitar just for a little bit.
- Get out of here, kid.

254
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,072
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

255
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,152
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! <i>Cállate!</i> Sh!

256
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,049
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,724
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.

258
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:13,513
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

259
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,934
Our family thinks music is a curse.

260
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,525
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

261
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,825
You would have told me to follow
my heart. To seize my moment!

262
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,791
So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna
play in the plaza. Just like you did!

263
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,505
The guitar! It's gone!

264
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,711
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

265
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,714
The window's broken. Look!

266
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,186
All right, who's in there?

267
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,352
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my--

268
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,227
There's nobody here.

269
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,039
- Miguel!
<i>- Mamá!</i>

270
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:24,090
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

271
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,757
<i>Dios mio!</i> Little boy. Are you okay?
Here. Let me help you.

272
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,010
Thanks. I--

273
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,943
Do you mind? Whoa!

274
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,588
Look how big she's getting.

275
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,258
Dante!

276
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:21,478
You can see me? Wait!
What's going on? Dante!

277
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,151
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:25,902
Miguel?

279
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,900
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

280
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,778
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

281
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,413
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

282
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,990
Remind me how I know you.

283
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,992
We're your family, <i>mijo.</i>

284
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,380
<i>- Tía</i> Rosita?
<i>- Sí.</i>

285
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,668
<i>- Papá</i> Julio?
<i>- Hola.</i>

286
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,011
<i>Tía</i> Victoria?

287
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,468
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

288
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,350
He's not quite alive either.

289
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,136
We need <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

290
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,853
<i>Oye!</i> It's <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.

291
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,650
She couldn't cross over.

292
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,194
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

293
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,772
<i>Tío</i> Oscar? <i>Tío</i> Felipe?

294
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,982
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

295
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,284
I have a feeling
this has something to do with you.

296
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,408
But if <i>Mamá</i> Imelda can't come to us...

297
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,785
Then we are going to her<i>. Vámonos!</i>

298
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,633
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

299
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,150
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

300
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,244
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

301
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,269
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

302
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,104
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

303
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,899
I thought it might've been one of those
made up things that adults tell kids.

304
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,698
- Like vitamins.
- Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

305
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,366
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

306
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,371
<i>Mija,</i> it's not nice to stare at--
<i>Ay!</i> Santa Maria!

307
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:53,550
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are--

308
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,382
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

309
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,134
They guide souls on their journey.

310
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,972
Watch your step.
They make <i>caquitas</i> everywhere.

311
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,638
<i>Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.</i>

312
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,474
<i>Please have all offerings ready
for re-entry.</i>

313
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,730
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

314
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,311
Some churros. From my family.

315
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,317
How wonderful. Next.

316
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,821
<i>If you are experiencing travel issues,
agents at the Department of Family...</i>

317
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,482
<i>Reunions are available to assist you.</i>

318
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,654
Next family, please.

319
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,499
Oh! Your photos are on your son's
<i>ofrenda.</i> Have a great visit.

320
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,408
<i>Gracias.</i>

321
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,662
<i>And remember to return
before sunrise. Enjoy your visit.</i>

322
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,669
Next. Your photo's on your
dentist's <i>ofrenda.</i> Enjoy your visit.

323
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,344
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Next?

324
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,886
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

325
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,725
Shall we skip the scanner?

326
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,187
I'm on so many <i>ofrendas</i>
it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

327
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,444
Well, shoot, looks like
no one put up your photo, Frida.

328
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,823
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now,
that was a lie.

329
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,199
And I apologize for doing that.

330
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,195
No photo on an <i>ofrenda,</i>
no crossing the bridge.

331
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,656
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

332
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,329
Hey!

333
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,295
Almost...there. Just a little further.

334
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,512
Upsy-daisy...

335
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,475
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

336
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,562
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

337
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,818
- Next?
- Oh! Come, <i>mijo.</i> It's our turn.

338
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,984
Welcome back, <i>amigos.</i>
Anything to declare?

339
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,532
As a matter of fact, yes.

340
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,234
<i>Hola.</i>

341
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,709
<i>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.</i>

342
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,012
I miss my nose.

343
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,029
Come on, help us out, <i>amigo.</i> We got
to get to a dozen <i>ofrendas</i> tonight.

344
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,608
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family
for <i>Día de Muertos!</i>

345
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,493
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

346
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,288
I'm sorry, <i>señora,</i>
it says here no one put up your photo.

347
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,793
My family always puts my photo
on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

348
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,921
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

349
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,630
<i>- Mamá</i> Imelda?
- Oh, <i>mi familia!</i>

350
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,294
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

351
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:48,433
Tell this woman and her devil box
that my photo is on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

352
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,766
Well, we never made it to the <i>ofrenda.</i>

353
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,771
- What?
- We ran into...

354
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,358
- Miguel?
<i>- Mamá</i> Imelda.

355
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,985
What is going on?

356
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,821
You the Rivera family?

357
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,663
- Well, you're cursed.
- What?

358
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,618
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> is the night to give
to the dead. You stole from the dead!

359
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,086
- But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
- Guitar?

360
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,631
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.

361
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:25,052
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.

362
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,130
You're all dead.

363
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,721
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

364
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,927
That's just Dante.

365
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,057
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

366
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,683
He just looks like a plain old dog.

367
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,773
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

368
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,603
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

369
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,438
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

370
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,899
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

371
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,116
But none of this explains why
I couldn't cross over.

372
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,196
Oh!

373
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,826
You took my photo off the <i>ofrenda?</i>

374
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,082
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

375
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,751
Well, since it's a family matter...

376
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:06,052
the way to undo a family curse
is to get your family's blessing.

377
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:06,753
That's it?

378
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,973
Get your family's blessing and
everything should go back to normal.

379
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,800
But you got to do it by sunrise.

380
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,635
What happens at sunrise?

381
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,728
<i>Híjole!</i> Your hand!

382
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,729
Whoa, Miguel,
can't have you fainting on us.

383
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,405
But not to worry. Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.

384
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:34,494
<i>Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.</i>
Aha! <i>Perdón, señora.</i>

385
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,246
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

386
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,210
Miguel.

387
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,631
Nailed it.
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

388
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,925
I give you my blessing.

389
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,055
I give you my blessing to go home...

390
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,519
to put my photo back on the <i>ofrenda,</i>
and to never play music again.

391
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,813
What? She can't do that!

392
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,733
Well, technically,
she can add any condition she wants.

393
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,692
- Fine.
- Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

394
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,000
No skeletons!

395
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,750
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

396
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,176
Two seconds
and you already break your promise.

397
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,304
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

398
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,096
<i>Papá</i> Julio, I ask for your blessing.

399
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,140
<i>Tía</i> Rosita? Oscar?

400
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,025
Felipe? <i>Tía</i> Victoria?

401
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,113
Don't make this hard, <i>mijo.</i>
You go home my way or no way.

402
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,236
You really hate music that much?

403
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,943
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

404
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,079
The same path he did. He's family.

405
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,037
- Listen to your <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.
- She's just looking out for you.

406
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,121
Be reasonable.

407
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:10,176
<i>Con permiso,</i> I need to visit
the restroom. Be right back.

408
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,464
Should we tell him there are no
restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

409
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,940
<i>Vámonos.</i>

410
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,488
We got a family looking for a living boy.

411
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,067
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

412
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,110
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

413
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,536
Hold it, <i>muchacho.</i>

414
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,495
I found that living boy! Oh, whoa,
excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

415
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,666
Excuse me.

416
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,470
No, no. Dante!

417
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:59,893
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow.

418
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,223
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

419
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,389
You need to clean up your act, <i>amigo.</i>

420
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:09,778
<i>Amigo?</i> Oh, that's so nice to hear you
say that because I have just had a...

421
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:14,065
really hard <i>Día de Muertos</i> and
I could really use an <i>amigo</i> right now.

422
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,655
And <i>amigos,</i> they help their <i>amigos.</i>

423
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,746
You get me across that bridge tonight,
and I'll make it worth your while.

424
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,617
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

425
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,416
I can get you front row seats
to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

426
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,459
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

427
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,207
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

428
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,421
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

429
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,634
But my shift's almost up
and I want to visit my living family.

430
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,932
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

431
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:45,055
- Can I at least get my costume back?
- No.

432
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,099
Some <i>amigo.</i>

433
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,612
Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz?

434
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,115
Who wants to--<i>Ay!</i> You're alive!

435
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,865
Sh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to
get back to the Land of the Living...

436
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,407
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

437
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,913
That's weirdly specific.

438
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,824
He's my great-great-grandfather.

439
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,955
He's your Gr-- What?

440
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,165
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

441
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,294
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

442
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,465
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

443
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,466
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good--

444
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,977
No, no, <i>niño! Niño, niño,</i> I can help you.
You can help me.

445
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,059
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.

446
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,765
- Miguel!
- I'm Héctor.

447
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,766
That's nice.

448
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,360
<i>Espérame, chamaco!</i>

449
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:50,788
<i>Ay,</i> he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.

450
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,305
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

451
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,221
Here. Nice alebrije.

452
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:25,742
<i>Ay, ay,</i> hold still. Look up<i>. A ver, a ver.</i>
Look up, up, up.

453
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:32,166
<i>Aqui arriba, eso...</i> Eh, <i>la rayita.</i>

454
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,706
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

455
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,083
Dead as a doorknob.

456
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,387
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

457
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,549
When you're well remembered, people
put up your photo and you get to...

458
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:48,595
cross the bridge and visit the living
on <i>Día de Muertos.</i> Unless you're me.

459
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,354
You don't get to cross over?

460
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,231
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!

461
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,484
This is you?

462
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,936
Eh, <i>muy guapo,</i> eh?

463
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,072
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...

464
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,949
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

465
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,783
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.

466
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,449
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

467
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,415
Like, tonight. So, you got
any other family here, you know?

468
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,671
Someone a bit more accessible?

469
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,540
Mm... Nope.

470
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,384
Don't yank my chain, <i>chamaco.</i>
You got to have some other family.

471
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,884
Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

472
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:29,219
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

473
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,817
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man. What are you doing?

474
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,443
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

475
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,149
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

476
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,782
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

477
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:49,447
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular? <i>Qué padre!</i>

478
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,121
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

479
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,626
to mark the end of <i>Día de Muertos.</i>

480
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,378
And you can get us in!

481
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,544
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

482
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,422
That...was a lie. I apologize for that.

483
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,088
Cool off, <i>chamaco.</i>
Come on. I'll get you to him.

484
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:05,971
How?

485
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,973
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

486
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,731
<i>Remember me
Don't let it make you cry</i>

487
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,279
You better have my dress, Héctor.

488
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,534
<i>Hola,</i> Ceci.

489
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,205
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

490
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,375
<i>Ya Io sabía!</i>

491
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,840
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

492
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,344
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

493
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,599
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

494
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,861
No, no, Dante! <i>Ven acá!</i>

495
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,747
You! How did you get in here?

496
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:22,002
- I just followed my--
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

497
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:27,925
Guider of wandering spirits. And
whose spirit have you guided to me?

498
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,389
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

499
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,306
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

500
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,354
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

501
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,731
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

502
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,952
You are the audience. Darkness.

503
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,449
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

504
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:03,916
Dancers emerge from the papaya,
and the dancers are all me.

505
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,587
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother, who is a cactus.

506
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:14,472
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.

507
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:16,893
Is it too obvious?

508
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,435
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

509
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,817
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

510
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,780
Oh! And then it could go...

511
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,454
And what if everything was on fire?

512
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,329
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

513
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,751
Inspired!
You have the spirit of an artist.

514
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,418
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.

515
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,804
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

516
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,930
Huh?

517
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,178
He does a couple of songs,
the sun rises, everyone cheers--

518
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,806
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

519
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,975
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

520
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,611
He's too busy hosting that fancy party
at the top of his tower.

521
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,327
<i>Chamaco,</i> you can't run off on me
like that. Stop pestering the celebrities.

522
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,367
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

523
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,203
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

524
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,789
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

525
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,622
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

526
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,506
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

527
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,669
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?

528
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,090
It's the hot ticket!

529
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,050
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never getting in, <i>Chorizo.</i>

530
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,468
Hey! It's <i>Chorizo! Choricito!</i>

531
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,938
- A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.
<i>- Chorizo?</i>

532
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:47,060
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

533
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,527
I don't want to talk about it.

534
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,439
He choked on some <i>chorizo!</i>

535
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,528
I didn't choke, okay? I got food
poisoning which is a big difference.

536
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,037
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.

537
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,785
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

538
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,790
If you really want to get to Ernesto,
there is that music competition...

539
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,752
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.

540
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,014
No, no<i>. Chamaco,</i>
you're <i>loco</i> if you think--

541
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,175
I need to get
my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

542
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,059
You know where I can get a guitar?

543
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,896
I know a guy.

544
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,703
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

545
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,411
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

546
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,660
- Size seven!
- And a half.

547
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,415
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

548
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,472
Why the heck
would you want to be a musician?

549
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,676
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

550
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,521
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers.

551
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,230
No thank you. No! <i>Guácala!</i>

552
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:11,276
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

553
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,311
We're almost there.

554
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,992
Keep up, <i>chamaco.</i> Come on.

555
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:32,457
- Cousin Héctor!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, <i>Tío!</i>

556
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,296
<i>- ¿ Qué onda?</i>
- These people are all your family?

557
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,801
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or <i>ofrendas.</i>

558
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,591
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

559
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,388
So, we all call each other cousin,
or <i>tío,</i> or whatever.

560
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,860
- Héctor!
<i>- Tía</i> Chelo!

561
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,652
<i>Muchas gracias!</i>

562
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,325
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharrón around?

563
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,280
Eh, in the bungalow. I don't know
if he's in the mood for visitors.

564
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,374
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Héctor?

565
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,339
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Chicharrón!

566
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,971
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Héctor.

567
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,513
Come on. It's <i>Día de Muertos.</i>
I brought you a little offering.

568
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,226
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

569
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,267
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

570
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,228
We really need to borrow your guitar.

571
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,976
- My guitar?
- Yes.

572
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,856
- My prized beloved guitar?
- I promise we'll bring it right back.

573
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,901
Like the time you promised to bring
back my van? Or my mini-fridge?

574
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,777
- Ah, you see--
- Or my good napkins?

575
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,487
My lasso? My femur?

576
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,157
- Well, no, not like those times.
- Where is my femur? You--

577
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,788
- You okay, <i>amigo?</i>
- I'm fading, Héctor.

578
00:43:55,716 --> 00:44:01,257
I can feel it. I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

579
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,721
You play me something.

580
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,558
No. You know I don't play anymore,
Cheech. The guitar is for the kid.

581
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,558
You want it, you got to earn it.

582
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,896
<i>Ay,</i> only for you, <i>amigo.</i>

583
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,074
Any requests?

584
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,904
You know my favorite, Héctor.

585
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,883
<i>Well, everyone knows Juanita</i>

586
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,763
<i>Her eyes each a different color</i>

587
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,070
<i>Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in</i>

588
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,614
<i>And her...</i>

589
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,781
<i>Knuckles they drag on the floor</i>

590
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,454
- Those aren't the words.
- There are children present.

591
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,163
<i>Her hair is like a briar</i>

592
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:18,122
<i>She stands in a bow-legged stance</i>

593
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,128
<i>And if I weren't so ugly</i>

594
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,352
<i>She'd possibly give me a chance</i>

595
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,647
Brings back memories.

596
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,816
<i>Gracias.</i>

597
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,807
Wait. What happened?

598
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,851
He's been forgotten.

599
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,237
When there's no one left in
the living world who remembers you...

600
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:29,368
you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.

601
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,162
Where did he go?

602
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,663
No one knows.

603
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,497
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!

604
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,252
No, it doesn't work like that, <i>chamaco.</i>

605
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:44,709
Our memories, they have to be passed
down by those who knew us in life...

606
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,377
in the stories they tell about us.

607
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,094
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

608
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,931
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

609
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,722
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

610
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,863
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.

611
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,907
How do you think
I knew your great-great-grandpa?

612
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,667
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.

613
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,502
<i>No manches!</i>
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...

614
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,381
the greatest musician of all time?

615
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:29,090
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

616
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,925
But his music? Eh, not so much.

617
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,889
You don't know
what you're talking about.

618
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:40,272
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
Showtime, <i>chamaco!</i>

619
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,197
<i>Llévelo!</i> T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

620
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,332
<i>Bienvenidos a todos!</i>

621
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,289
Who's ready for some <i>música?</i>

622
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,751
It's a battle of the bands, <i>amigos.</i>

623
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:14,131
The winner gets to play for the maestro
himself, Ernesto de la Cruz...

624
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,641
at his <i>fiesta</i> tonight!

625
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,597
That's our ticket, <i>muchacho.</i>

626
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,440
Let the competition begin!

627
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,079
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

628
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,585
Definitely <i>Remember Me.</i>

629
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,918
- No! Not that one. No.
- Come on. It's his most popular song!

630
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,332
It's too popular.

631
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,421
<i>Remember me
Though I have to travel far</i>

632
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,678
<i>- Remember me...
- Don't let it make you cry...</i>

633
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,686
- What about <i>Poco Loco?
- Epa!</i> Now that's a song!

634
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,349
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

635
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,689
Los Chachalacos!

636
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,789
You always this nervous
before a performance?

637
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,952
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

638
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,086
What? You said you were a musician!

639
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,755
I am! I mean, I will be.

640
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,215
<i>- Ay!</i>
- Once I win.

641
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:34,545
That's your plan? No. You have to win.
Your life literally depends on...

642
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,214
you winning. And you've never
done this before! I'll go up there.

643
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,633
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

644
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,850
If I can't go out and play one song,
how can I call myself a musician?

645
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:44,979
What does that matter?

646
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,190
Because I don't just want to get
de la Cruz's blessing...

647
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,236
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

648
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,609
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment
at such a bad time!

649
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,199
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!

650
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,418
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

651
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,382
Now give me your best <i>grito.</i>

652
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,006
- My best <i>grito?</i>
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

653
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:21,308
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

654
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,436
Oh, come on, kid.

655
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,027
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

656
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,865
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.
You can do this.

657
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,791
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

658
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,461
Make them listen, <i>chamaco.</i>
You've got this.

659
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,747
De la Cruzcito!

660
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,633
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

661
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,636
Bring back the singing dogs!

662
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,196
<i>Qué bien! Vámonos!</i> Whoo!

663
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,787
<i>What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

664
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:35,583
<i>You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

665
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,127
<i>Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

666
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:44,099
<i>You say put them on your head
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

667
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,687
<i>You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco</i>

668
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,061
<i>The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing</i>

669
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,109
<i>I'll count it as a blessing</i>

670
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,151
<i>That I'm only un poco loco</i>

671
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,192
No! No! No!

672
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,870
- Not bad for a dead guy!
- Not so bad yourself, <i>gordito! Eso!</i>

673
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,756
He's close! Find him!

674
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,553
<i>The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy</i>

675
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,513
<i>The sense that you're not making</i>

676
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,552
<i>The liberties you're taking</i>

677
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:35,650
<i>Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco</i>

678
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,779
- We're looking for a living kid.
- About twelve?

679
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,656
Have you seen a living boy?

680
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:55,921
<i>Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to
loco</i>

681
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,892
Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you<i>. Eso!</i>

682
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,933
<i>Otra! Otra! Otra!</i>

683
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,612
- Hey! Where are you going?
- We got to get out of here!

684
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,906
What? Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.

685
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,777
<i>Damas y caballeros,</i>
I have an emergency announcement.

686
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:33,292
Please be on the lookout for a living
boy. Answers to the name of Miguel.

687
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,953
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

688
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,797
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

689
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,043
Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

690
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,961
The only person
who could send you home.

691
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,380
I do have other family, but--

692
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,219
You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?

693
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,218
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

694
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,303
- You lied to me!
- You're one to talk.

695
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,726
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

696
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,603
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

697
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,314
I'm not gonna miss my one chance
to cross that bridge because...

698
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,230
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

699
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,569
- It's not stupid!
- I'm taking you to your family.

700
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,154
- Let go of me!
- You'll thank me later.

701
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,740
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

702
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,327
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

703
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,490
No!

704
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,958
Hey, <i>chamaco!</i> Where did you go?

705
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,708
<i>Chamaco!</i> I'm sorry! Come back!

706
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,102
Dante, <i>cállate!</i> No! Dante, stop it.

707
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:43,020
He can't help me. Dante! Stop!

708
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,067
Stop it! Leave me alone!

709
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:49,651
You're not a spirit guide. You're just
a dumb dog! Now get out of here!

710
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,536
- It's him!
- It's that living boy!

711
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,197
- I heard about him. Look!
- He's alive!

712
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,699
- He's alive.
- The boy is alive!

713
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,633
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

714
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,469
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

715
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,053
I don't want your blessing!

716
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,226
Miguel, stop!

717
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:22,192
Come back! Miguel!

718
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,815
I am trying to save your life!

719
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,908
- You're ruining my life!
- What?

720
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:35,573
Music's the only thing that makes me
happy. And you want to take it away.

721
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,907
You'll never understand.

722
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,836
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

723
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,753
<i>No dejaré de quererte...</i>

724
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,927
I thought you hated music.

725
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:58,053
I loved it! I remember that feeling...

726
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:04,769
when my husband would play, and
I would sing and nothing else mattered.

727
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:10,941
But when we had Coco, suddenly
there was something in my life that...

728
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:16,204
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

729
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,912
He wanted to play for the world.

730
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:24,462
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

731
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,873
Now you must make a choice.

732
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,793
But I don't want to pick sides!

733
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,305
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.

734
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:39,094
Support you. But you never will.

735
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,078
- Have a good time.
- Oh, how exciting!

736
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:07,339
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

737
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,344
<i>Gracias, Señor.</i>

738
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,638
- Invitation?
- It's okay.

739
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,677
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

740
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,526
<i>- Disculpen, señores...</i>
- Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

741
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,036
- You were on fire tonight!
- You too!

742
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,699
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

743
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:49,043
The competition winners.
Congratulations, <i>chicos.</i>

744
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,887
Thanks, guys!

745
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,528
- Hey! Enjoy the party, little <i>músico!
- Gracias!</i>

746
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:21,787
Oh!

747
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,590
Look! It's Ernesto!

748
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,301
De la Cruz!

749
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,221
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz!

750
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:45,390
Pardon me!
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz! <i>Señor</i> de la--

751
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,937
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

752
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,776
<i>You must seize it.</i>

753
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,941
<i>This one has a wise spirit.</i>

754
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,465
<i>We're almost there, Dante.</i>

755
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,089
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz! <i>Señor</i> de la--

756
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,393
<i>But what can we do? It is hopeless...</i>

757
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,147
<i>- You must have faith, sister.
- But</i> Padre, <i>he will never listen.</i>

758
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,858
<i>He will listen... to music.</i>

759
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:04,967
<i>Señoras y señores, buenas tardes,
buenas noches</i>

760
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,891
<i>Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Señoritas y señores</i>

761
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,357
<i>To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Qué alegría</i>

762
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:18,147
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

763
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:24,198
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

764
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:30,955
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

765
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,744
<i>For this music is my lang--</i>

766
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,716
Are you all right, <i>niño?</i>

767
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:55,892
It's you! You are that boy! The one
who came from the Land of the Living.

768
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,026
You...know about me?

769
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:02,900
You are all anyone has been talking
about. Why have you come here?

770
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,867
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

771
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,741
I... have a great-great-grandson?

772
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:15,666
I need your blessing so I can go
back home and be a musician.

773
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:20,671
Just like you. The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

774
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,007
But I hoped you would.

775
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:30,556
My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?

776
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,019
I have a great-great-grandson!

777
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,025
- Look! It's Frida!
- Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

778
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,245
- It is an honor, <i>Señora.
- Gracias.</i>

779
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,124
Hey, Negrete! Infante! Have you
met my great-great-grandson?

780
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,376
My great-great-grandson.

781
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,794
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

782
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,793
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

783
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:04,965
No dimple!

784
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,382
<i>To our friendship.</i>

785
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,474
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

786
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,306
Poison!

787
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,597
You know, I did all my own stunts.

788
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,396
<i>Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me...</i>

789
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,777
All of this came from my amazing fans
in the Land of the Living.

790
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,944
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

791
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,953
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

792
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,334
- No! It's all great!
- But?

793
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:41,581
It's just-- I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

794
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:45,468
You're the guy who actually did it!

795
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:51,930
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?

796
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:58,224
It was hard. Saying goodbye to
my hometown. Heading off on my own...

797
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:00,687
Leaving your family?

798
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,860
<i>Sí.</i> But I could not have
done it differently.

799
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,367
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

800
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:14,155
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

801
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,205
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.

802
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,706
The world is our family.

803
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,960
The fireworks have begun!

804
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:42,058
Soon the party will move across town
for my Sunrise Spectacular.

805
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:47,731
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!

806
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,990
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

807
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,656
I can't.
I have to get home before sunrise.

808
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,825
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

809
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,751
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

810
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,919
I hope you die very soon.

811
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,135
You know what I mean.

812
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,896
- Miguel, I give you my bless--
- We had a deal, <i>chamaco.</i>

813
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,267
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

814
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,437
Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

815
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,282
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.

816
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,275
You know this man?

817
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,662
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

818
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,198
Héctor?

819
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,706
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

820
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,257
My friend, you're being forgotten.

821
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:50,630
- And whose fault is that?
- Héctor, please...

822
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,508
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

823
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,380
What?

824
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,638
If I'm being forgotten, it's because
you never told anyone that I wrote them!

825
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,853
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

826
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,097
You want to tell him or should I?

827
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:08,979
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died...

828
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:13,988
and I only sang your songs because
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

829
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,617
How generous!

830
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,904
You really did play together.

831
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,121
I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.

832
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,957
Miguel can put my photo up,
and I can cross over the bridge.

833
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:31,547
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

834
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,044
That was a long time ago.

835
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,513
We drank together and you told me
you would move Heaven and Earth...

836
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:40,472
for your <i>amigo.</i>
Well, I'm asking you to now.

837
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,145
Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie?

838
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,731
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

839
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,143
In the de la Cruz movie,
<i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

840
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:52,113
- I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
- No! It's in there. Look!

841
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,860
<i>Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!</i>

842
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,620
<i>I would move Heaven
and Earth for you,</i> mi amigo.

843
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,785
But in the movie,
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

844
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,876
<i>- Salud!</i>
- Poison!

845
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,548
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

846
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,467
<i>We'd been performing on the road
for months. I got homesick...</i>

847
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,217
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

848
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,426
You want to give up now when
we're this close to reaching our dream?

849
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,394
This was your dream. You'll manage.

850
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,229
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

851
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:30,021
I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me
if you want, but my mind is made up.

852
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:39,494
I could never hate you. If you must go,
then I'm sending you off with a toast.

853
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,577
To our friendship.

854
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:48,916
I would move Heaven and Earth for you,
<i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

855
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,754
<i>You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.</i>

856
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,263
<i>I thought
it must have been something I ate.</i>

857
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,265
Perhaps it was that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

858
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,144
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

859
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,516
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

860
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,607
You poisoned me.

861
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,024
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

862
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,444
All this time,
I thought it was just bad luck.

863
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,784
<i>I never thought that you might have--
That you...</i>

864
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,337
- How could you?
- Héctor!

865
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,421
Security! Security!

866
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,420
You took everything away from me!
You rat!

867
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,347
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

868
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,681
I just wanted to go back home. No! No!

869
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,274
I apologize. Where were we?

870
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,769
You were going to
give me your blessing.

871
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,108
Yes<i>. Sí.</i>

872
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:03,152
Miguel, my reputation...

873
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:09,458
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...

874
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:13,000
That you murdered
Héctor for his songs?

875
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:18,042
You don't think that. Do you?

876
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:22,763
I-- No.
Everyone knows you're the good guy.

877
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,181
<i>Papá</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

878
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:39,322
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

879
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,782
What? But I'm your family!

880
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,026
And Héctor was my best friend.

881
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,197
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

882
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:53,124
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to seize your moment.

883
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,875
I know you understand.

884
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,041
No! No!

885
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,087
Let go! No!

886
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:32,075
Help! Can anyone hear me?
I want to go home.

887
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,428
- Héctor?
- Kid?

888
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:58,272
Héctor! You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.

889
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:02,688
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,
but I didn't listen.

890
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,616
I told them
I didn't care if they remembered me.

891
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,778
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

892
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,656
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i> It's okay. It's okay.

893
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,249
I told them I didn't care.

894
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:21,131
Héctor! Héctor?

895
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,793
She's forgetting me.

896
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,635
- Who?
- My daughter.

897
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:35,016
She's the reason
you wanted to cross the bridge.

898
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:41,314
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

899
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,779
I wish I could apologize.

900
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,151
I wish I could tell her that
her <i>papá</i> was trying to come home.

901
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,279
That he loved her so much.

902
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,077
My Coco...

903
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,248
Coco?

904
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,809
Where did you get this?

905
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:22,480
That's my <i>Mamá</i> Coco.
That's my <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.

906
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,317
Is that you?

907
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,492
We're... family?

908
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:50,547
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.

909
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:54,888
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

910
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,515
You know the worst part?

911
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,727
Even if I never got to see Coco
in the living world...

912
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,816
I thought at least one day I'd see
her here. Give her the biggest hug.

913
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,615
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

914
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,781
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

915
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:19,834
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.

916
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,584
Ever again.

917
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,374
You know, I wrote her a song once.

918
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:31,508
We used to sing it every night
at the same time.

919
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,423
No matter how far apart we were.

920
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:41,105
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her
one... last... time.

921
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,273
<i>Remember me</i>

922
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:51,114
<i>Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me</i>

923
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,865
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

924
01:12:55,955 --> 01:13:01,121
<i>For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart</i>

925
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:06,543
<i>I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart</i>

926
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,459
<i>Remember me</i>

927
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,089
<i>Papá!</i>

928
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,306
<i>Though I have to travel far
Remember me</i>

929
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,811
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

930
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:27,226
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

931
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:33,782
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

932
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:42,333
<i>Remember me</i>

933
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:51,675
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

934
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:56,004
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

935
01:13:56,182 --> 01:14:00,347
I didn't write <i>Remember Me</i>
for the world. I wrote it for Coco.

936
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

937
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,726
Are you kidding? A minute ago
I thought I was related to a murderer.

938
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:13,652
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something...

939
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,363
that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.

940
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,696
But now I know. It comes from you.

941
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:26,998
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

942
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,091
I'm proud to be his family!

943
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,069
Dante?

944
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,448
Dante!

945
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,360
It's Dante!

946
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,420
- Imelda!
- Héctor.

947
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,634
You look good.

948
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,271
Dante! You knew he was my
<i>Papá</i> Héctor the whole time!

949
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,356
You are a real spirit guide.

950
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,942
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

951
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,338
Dante!

952
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:21,988
There they are!

953
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:26,781
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

954
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,788
<i>Gracias, Dios mío.
Qué bueno.</i>

955
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,227
<i>Mijo,</i> I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.

956
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:54,016
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

957
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,899
Imelda.

958
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,361
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

959
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,990
I spent decades protecting my family
from your mistakes.

960
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,532
He spends five minutes with you
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

961
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,320
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

962
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:11,871
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!

963
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:16,038
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

964
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,540
Nothing's more important than family.

965
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,882
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

966
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:27,049
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

967
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,384
To get Héctor's photo.

968
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,894
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

969
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,348
Héctor should be on our <i>ofrenda.</i>
He's part of our family.

970
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,602
He left this family!

971
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:39,193
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!

972
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:44,400
- It's true, Imelda.
- And so what if it's true?

973
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,739
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

974
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,904
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

975
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,071
Imelda, I--

976
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,282
Héctor!

977
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,414
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

978
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,174
She's forgetting you.

979
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:07,302
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.

980
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:12,139
I wanted to forget you.

981
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,182
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

982
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,941
This is my fault. Not yours.

983
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,150
I'm sorry, Imelda.

984
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:32,573
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,
you will return home?

985
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,115
No more music?

986
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,748
Family comes first.

987
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,250
I can't forgive you.

988
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,965
But I will help you.

989
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,341
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

990
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,761
I might know a way.

991
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,614
- Good luck, <i>muchacho.
- Gracias,</i> Frida.

992
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,366
- Here, let me help you with--
- Don't touch me!

993
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,623
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Héctor's photo.

994
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,629
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

995
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:04,998
Got your petals?

996
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,381
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

997
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,294
Yes?

998
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,300
Don't I know you?

999
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,512
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1000
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,977
- Who-- Who the--
- She's talking about me!

1001
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,890
- I'm the love of your life?
- I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

1002
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,436
Héctor! How did you--

1003
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,356
And that's for trying to
murder my grandson.

1004
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,312
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

1005
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:31,820
You! Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1006
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,072
The photo!

1007
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,699
After him!

1008
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,915
Security! <i>Ayúdenme!</i>

1009
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,960
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

1010
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,207
That's what I heard.

1011
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,098
Places, <i>Señor.</i>
You're on in thirty seconds.

1012
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:12,365
<i>Ay!</i> Miguel! I have it!

1013
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,711
Hurry! Come on!

1014
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,136
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1015
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:39,222
<i>the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!</i>

1016
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,561
Get her off the stage.

1017
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,492
Sing! Sing!

1018
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:11,838
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

1019
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,555
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1020
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,892
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

1021
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:29,355
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1022
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:36,032
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1023
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:44,830
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1024
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,709
<i>Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona</i>

1025
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,296
<i>A ver si te divisaba</i>

1026
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:57,383
<i>Como el pino era tierno, Llorona</i>

1027
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,133
<i>Al verme llorar, lloraba</i>

1028
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:07,932
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1029
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:15,151
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1030
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,326
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1031
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,454
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1032
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:26,245
- Let go of me!
<i>- Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1033
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:36,876
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1034
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,256
<i>Ay, ay, ay</i>

1035
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,107
I forgot what that felt like.

1036
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,936
You still got it.

1037
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,786
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1038
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:10,953
To go home, to put up our photos
and to never--

1039
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:12,836
Never play music again.

1040
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:19,219
To never forget
how much your family loves you.

1041
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,426
You're going home.

1042
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:28,599
You're not going anywhere.

1043
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:31,647
Imelda!

1044
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:37,275
Stay back! Stay back! All of you,
stay back. Not one more step.

1045
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,781
Dante!

1046
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,200
Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone.

1047
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:50,450
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1048
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,669
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1049
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,170
He's a threat!

1050
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,832
<i>You think I'd let him go back to
the Land of the Living with your photo?</i>

1051
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:01,006
To keep your memory alive? No.

1052
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,551
- You're a coward!
- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1053
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,674
The greatest musician of all time!

1054
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,641
Héctor's the real musician.

1055
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,261
<i>You're just the guy who murdered him
and stole his songs!</i>

1056
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,266
Murdered?

1057
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:15,312
I am the one who's willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment.

1058
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,484
Whatever it takes.

1059
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,113
No!

1060
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,492
Miguel!

1061
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,704
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1062
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,658
Please, please, <i>mi familia.</i>

1063
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,626
Murderer!

1064
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,087
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one--

1065
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:24,590
<i>Remember me
Though I have to s--</i>Hey!

1066
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:27,551
Look!

1067
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,611
Nice kitty.

1068
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:58,544
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1069
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,421
No! No!

1070
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,525
What did I miss?

1071
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,277
Good boy, Dante!

1072
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,779
Miguel!

1073
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:30,155
Héctor! The photo... I lost it!

1074
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,738
It's okay, <i>mijo.</i> It's o--

1075
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:36,074
Héctor! Héctor?

1076
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:38,284
Coco.

1077
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,332
No! We can still find the photo.

1078
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,538
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1079
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,333
No, no. I can't leave you.

1080
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,096
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.

1081
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,257
We're both out of time, <i>mijo.</i>

1082
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,849
Oh no! No! She can't forget you!

1083
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,857
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

1084
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,812
- Héctor!
- You have our blessing, Miguel.

1085
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,188
No conditions.

1086
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,074
No! <i>Papá</i> Héctor, please!

1087
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,368
No!

1088
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,794
- Go home.
- I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1089
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,239
There he is!

1090
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,613
Miguel! Stop!

1091
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,584
- Where have you been?
- I need to see <i>Mamá</i> Coco, please.

1092
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,416
What are you doing with that--
Give it to me!

1093
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:09,425
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

1094
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:14,551
<i>Mamá</i> Coco?
Can you hear me? It's Miguel.

1095
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:18,718
I saw your <i>papá.</i> Remember? <i>Papá?</i>

1096
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:25,559
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1097
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,435
Miguel, open this door!

1098
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:32,027
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?

1099
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:40,782
See? There he is! <i>Papá!</i>
Remember? <i>Papá?</i>

1100
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:48,297
- Miguel!
<i>- Mamá</i> Coco, please! Don't forget him.

1101
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,844
What are you doing to that poor
woman? It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i> It's okay.

1102
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,467
What's gotten into you?

1103
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,980
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1104
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,564
I'm sorry, <i>Papá.</i>

1105
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,776
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

1106
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:14,941
Not all of us.

1107
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:20,242
It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i> Miguel,
you apologize to your <i>Mamá</i> Coco.

1108
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,079
<i>Mamá</i> Coco?

1109
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,582
Well? Apologize!

1110
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:41,764
<i>Mamá</i> Coco?
Your <i>papá,</i> he wanted you to have this.

1111
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,475
<i>Mamá,</i> wait!

1112
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:49,484
<i>Remember me</i>

1113
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,608
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

1114
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,365
<i>Remember me</i>

1115
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,698
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

1116
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,364
<i>For even if I'm far away</i>

1117
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:09,378
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

1118
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:12,715
<i>Each night we are apart</i>

1119
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,802
<i>Remember me</i>

1120
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,806
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

1121
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,597
<i>Remember me</i>

1122
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,392
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

1123
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:34,570
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

1124
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:40,864
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

1125
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:48,456
<i>Remember me</i>

1126
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,212
Elena? What's wrong, <i>mija?</i>

1127
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:04,221
Nothing, <i>Mamá.</i> Nothing at all.

1128
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:08,604
My <i>papá</i> used to sing me that song.

1129
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,391
He loved you, <i>Mamá</i> Coco.

1130
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,687
Your <i>papá</i> loved you so much.

1131
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,633
I kept his letters.

1132
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:42,547
Poems he wrote me. And...

1133
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,660
<i>Papá</i> was a musician.

1134
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,071
When I was a little girl...

1135
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,998
he and <i>Mamá</i>
would sing such beautiful songs.

1136
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:29,852
And right over here, one of
Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

1137
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:33,689
The home of the esteemed song writer,
Héctor Rivera.

1138
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:38,103
The letters Héctor wrote home for
his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics...

1139
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,818
for all of your favorite songs.
Not just <i>Remember Me.</i>

1140
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,870
And that man is your <i>Papá</i> Julio.

1141
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,203
And there's <i>Tía</i> Rosita
and your <i>Tía</i> Victoria.

1142
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,210
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1143
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,337
These aren't just old pictures,
they're our family...

1144
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,544
and they're counting on us
to remember them.

1145
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:22,648
<i>Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool</i>

1146
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,698
Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

1147
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,416
<i>But last night it seemed that
I dreamed about you</i>

1148
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:39,751
<i>- Papá!</i>
- Coco!

1149
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:44,589
<i>When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song</i>

1150
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:50,429
<i>And you know every word
and we all sang along</i>

1151
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:57,724
<i>To a melody played
on the strings of our souls</i>

1152
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:02,692
<i>And a rhythm that rattled us
down to the bone</i>

1153
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:07,609
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

1154
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:14,120
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1155
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:18,787
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

1156
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:24,717
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1157
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:32,179
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

1158
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:36,437
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

1159
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:40,270
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

1160
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:44,437
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1161
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:49,067
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

1162
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:52,866
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

1163
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,034
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

1164
01:35:57,001 --> 01:36:01,462
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>
